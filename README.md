Design of an Underactuated Gripper with Application in Robotic Locomotion

The task of manipulation, in the field of robotics, defined as the area in which multiple manipulators or fingers cooperate to secure and orientate objects is identified as one of the main areas to explore in the future. Simultaneously, in the recent light of the studies conducted in mechanism theory, kinematics, dynamics and mechatronics, legged robots are being studied to conquer rough terrains. The following dissertation promotes the development of a platform, capable of being mounted on a leg of a four-legged robot and execute tasks of manipulation with high dexterity with sensors to detect and control the force exerted on the object. In this way, the function of manipulation that would involve the addition of a manipulator to the robot skeleton, increasing its weight and diminishing its global energy efficiency, could be done with one of its legs, while the others would be used to balance the robot. In this work, it is used an open-source CAD project which was modified in order to: increase the grasping configurations, integrate tactile and force sensors on the distal phalanxes, actuate individually each finger and making each finger capable of opening to such an extent, placing it above the palm, so that the system could be in contact with the terrain. The dissertation follows the creation of a 3-finger gripper with four actuators and seven articulations, thanks to the sub actuation mechanism that uses a spring, connecting the proximal phalanx to the distal phalanx. The entire system is projected in such a way that it is possible to print it in a 3D printer and uses off-the-shelf sensors so that it can serve as an investigation platform for future works in manipulation or legged locomotion.
